# Senior Support Services #

Senior Support Services allows seniors and their loved ones to list, rate and track agencies that provide  
support services to older adults in their homes. If you find yourself overwhelmed with the multitude of   
agencies available for the older population, this application will help keep you organized and give you   
peace of mind.

## Background Story ##

-Having experienced a recent health crisis and care needs concerning both of my parents primarily my Motherâ€™s   
diagnosis with kidney cancer, the need for additional care in the home became necessary.  Finding the right   
caregivers was imperative. Frustrated by the multitude of options and varying quality provided by each agency,   
I decided to create an app that would allow the user (me) to rate agencies and keep track of those that were   
beneficial and those that were not so helpful.
